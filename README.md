# Git-Colab

Git Collaboration
One of the main advantages of being comfortable with git is that it allows you the ability to collaborate with teams through organizations and shared repositories hosted here on Github. Git is used for Version Control, which allows us to save versioned copies of our project codebases as we add to them. Typically, we'll store these codebases here on Github. However, git also allows for collaboration.

Take a second to think about how we've been receiving and submitting homework in this course.

Forking and cloning a repository
Adding changes and commiting them
Pushing to our forked remote repository
Finally, making a pull request on the main repository with our changes
In actuality, we've been doing git collaboration all along! In the case of our homework, we've been using the fork and pull request method of collaboration.
