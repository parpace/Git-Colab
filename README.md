# Git-Colab

Git Collaboration
One of the main advantages of being comfortable with git is that it allows you the ability to collaborate with teams through organizations and shared repositories hosted here on Github. Git is used for Version Control, which allows us to save versioned copies of our project codebases as we add to them. Typically, we'll store these codebases here on Github. However, git also allows for collaboration.

Take a second to think about how we've been receiving and submitting homework in this course.

Forking and cloning a repository
Adding changes and commiting them
Pushing to our forked remote repository
Finally, making a pull request on the main repository with our changes
In actuality, we've been doing git collaboration all along! In the case of our homework, we've been using the fork and pull request method of collaboration.

We'll be using the central repository feature branch method of collaboration for our group projects in this course. While this is the way we'll be collaborating in this course, there are other methods out there.


Adding Collaborators
When starting a new group project with a feature branch workflow, what we'll need to do first is add collaborators to the project.

## To add collaborators on a repository:

*Click on the Settings tab at the top right of the page*
Within settings, click on the section titled Collaborators and teams
You'll see a button for inviting people and organizations
Click on it and enter in the collaborators you'd like to work with on the project

> Once you invite them, they'll need to respond to the invite email sent to their email associated with their Github account

I'm gonna fuck this up
